# ProTipster Front-end Test

Your job is to create a simple web application allowing you to browse football matches up to a week ago and up to a week ahead.

## Data

Register an account at https://developer.sportradar.com/ and get a 30-day trial access to Soccer API.

## Requirements

You can play around with how you want to display the list of matches.

It can be a single list, you can split it into two (past and upcoming) as well as show them day by day.

For each match display a date and time adjusted to the timezone of the browser, tournament name, and team names.

Add a subpage for every past match with half-time and final scores and basic statistics like cards and players who scored.

For upcoming matches add a subpage where team lines-ups and league table will be available.

Bonus points if you make everything available in two languages: English and Polish.

## What to do when I'm finished?

Please commit changes to the shared respository and when you are finished send a quick information back to dawid.janik@baytekin.info.

## Good Luck
